So you ended up making a film for them?{{end}}\n{{end}}\n{{paragraph}}\n{{time}}65.37/76.03{{end}}\n{{raw}}**Stewart**: Yeah. It was a film to train the employees in " +

    " but I'd allowed time for it.{{end}}\n{{time}}102.63/110.08{{end}}\n{{raw}} And even though it was the middle of winter, there wasn't any snow, so I didn't have any transport problems.{{end}}\n{{end}}\n{{paragraph}}\n{{time}}110.25/115.20{{end}}\n{{raw}}**Tutor**: Right.

I think they were quite surprised at how well I managed that.{{end}}\n{{time}}120.93/127.25{{end}}\n{{raw}} It was just the luck of the draw actually, I'd done that project with you last year...{{end}}\n{{end}}\n{{paragraph}}\n{{time}}127.25/129.43{{end}}\n{{raw}}**Tutor**: Oh, " +
    "on recording technology?{{end}}\n{{time}}129.85/132.94{{end}}\n{{raw}} So you knew a bit about it from that, right.{{end}}\n{{end}}\n{{paragraph}}\n{{time}}132.94/138.92{{end}}\n{{raw}}**Stewart**: Yeah. What I found really hard was actually writing the script.{{end}}\n{{time}}139.40/144.32{{end}}\n{{raw}} I had a deadline for that but the Association " +

    "that, yeah.{{end}}\n{{end}}\n{{paragraph}}\n{{time}}153.84/164.12{{end}}\n{{raw}}**Tutor**: Right. Now from your draft report it sounds as if you had one or two problems deciding who was going to actually appear in the video.{{end}}\n{{end}}\n{{paragraph}}\n{{time}}164.24/165.77{{end}}\n{{raw}}**Stewart**: The casting? Yeah.{{end}}\n{{time}}166.52/173.06" +

    " So that was a big help for me.{{end}}\n{{end}}\n{{paragraph}}\n{{time}}195.13/199.19{{end}}\n{{raw}}**Tutor**: Right. And it sounds like the filming itself went well.{{end}}\n{{end}}\n{{paragraph}}\n{{time}}199.58/205.47{{end}}\n{{raw}}**Stewart**: I gather you found a company who provided an online introduction to the techniques.{{end}}\n{{end}}\n{{paragraph}}" +

It was really informative, and very user-friendly.{{end}}\n{{time}}210.28/211.68{{end}}\n{{raw}} I learned a lot from it.{{end}}\n{{end}}\n{{paragraph}}\n{{time}}211.99/213.25{{end}}\n{{raw}}**Tutor**: And then the editing?{{end}}\n{{end}}\n{{paragraph}}\n{{time}}213.99/232.00{{end}}\n{{raw}}**Stewart**:" +
    " For that, the Association put me in touch with someone who works for one of the big movie companies and I went down to the studio and sat with him in front of his computer for a day, learning how to cut and paste, and deal with the soundtrack and so on.{{end}}\n{{end}}\n{{paragraph}}\n{{time}}232.30/233.57{{end}}\n{{raw}}**Tutor**: So was that all?{{end}}\n{{end}}" +
    "\n{{paragraph}}\n{{time}}233.82/244.03{{end}}\n{{raw}}**Stewart**: No, I didn't include this in my draft report but I had to design the cover for the DVD as well, the lettering and everything.{{end}}\n{{end}}\n{{paragraph}}\n{{time}}244.38/247.69{{end}}\n{{raw}}**Tutor**: Have you done any of that sort of design work before?{{end}}\n{{end}}\n{{paragraph}}\n{{time}}" +
    "247.95/264.02{{end}}\n{{raw}}**Stewart**: No, but I did a rough draft and then talked it through with a couple of my mates and they gave me some more ideas, and when I'd finished it, I showed it to the people who worked at the Association and they really liked it.{{end}}\n{{end}}\n{{paragraph}}\n{{time}}264.08/265.13{{end}}\n{{raw}}**Tutor**: Excellent.{{end}}\n" +

I suppose if I hadn't made the film for them, they'd have had to get an outside company to do it.{{end}}\n{{time}}322.32/330.34{{end}}\n{{raw}} But because I was actually working for the Association, I'd got much more of a" +

    " Right. And the Association also said that because of your background, you had a good idea of where to go to get the best deal for the equipment you needed.{{end}}\n{{time}}353.85/360.88{{end}}\n{{raw}} They said the saving in expense made it worthwhile even though sourcing it took quite a bit of time.{{end}}\n{{end}}\n{{paragraph}}\n{{time}}360.88/361.96{{end}}\n{{raw}}**Stewart**:" +
    " Yes, that's true.{{end}}\n{{end}}\n{{paragraph}}\n{{time}}362.47/370.53{{end}}\n{{raw}}**Tutor**: The Association also said making the film had a very positive effect in getting staff to work together more closely.{{end}}\n{{end}}\n{{paragraph}}\n{{time}}370.65/373.80{{end}}\n{{raw}}**Stewart**: Oh. I hadn't heard that. That's good.{{end}}\n{{time}}374.49/385.04{{end}}\n{{raw}} " +
    "And certainly, people weren't afraid to tell me what they thought about it as I was making it, so I was able to get lots of feedback at every stage.{{end}}\n{{time}}385.56/391.56{{end}}\n{{raw}} That was useful for me but it also meant the final product worked better for them.{{end}}\n{{end}}\n{{paragraph}}\n{{time}}392.21/394.56{{end}}\n{{raw}}**Tutor**: Can you think of any other" +
